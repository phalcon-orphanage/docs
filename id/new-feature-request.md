# New Feature Request

A NFR is a short document explaining how a new feature request must be submitted, how it can be implemented, and how it can help core developers and others to understand implement it.

A NFR contains: * Suggested syntax * Suggested class names and methods * A short documentation * If the feature is already implemented in other frameworks, a short explanation of how that was implemented and its advantages

In the following cases a new feature request will be rejected: * The feature makes the framework slow * The feature doesn't provide any additional value to the framework * The NFR is not clear, bad documentation, unclear explanation, etc. * The NFR doesn't follow the current guidelines/philosophy of the framework * The NFR affects/breaks applications developed in current/older versions of the framework * The original poster doesn't provide feedback/input when requested * It's technically impossible to implement * It can only be used in the development/testing stages * Submitted/proposed classes/components don't follow the [Single Responsibility Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) * Static methods aren't allowed

To send a NFR you don't need to provide Zephir or C code or develop the feature. New Feture requests explain the goal of the intended implementation and open discussion on how best to implement it.

All NFRs should be posted as a new issue on [Github](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/issues).
