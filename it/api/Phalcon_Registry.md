# Final class **Phalcon\\Registry**

*implements* [ArrayAccess](http://php.net/manual/en/class.arrayaccess.php), [Countable](http://php.net/manual/en/class.countable.php), [Iterator](http://php.net/manual/en/class.iterator.php), [Traversable](http://php.net/manual/en/class.traversable.php)

A registry is a container for storing objects and values in the application space. By storing the value in a registry, the same object is always available throughout your application.

```php
<?php

$registry = new \Phalcon\Registry();

// Set value
$registry->something = "something";
// or
$registry["something"] = "something";

// Get value
$value = $registry->something;
// or
$value = $registry["something"];

// Check if the key exists
$exists = isset($registry->something);
// or
$exists = isset($registry["something"]);

// Unset
unset($registry->something);
// or
unset($registry["something"]);

```

In addition to ArrayAccess, Phalcon\\Registry also implements Countable (count($registry) will return the number of elements in the registry), Serializable and Iterator (you can iterate over the registry using a foreach loop) interfaces. For PHP 5.4 and higher, JsonSerializable interface is implemented.

Phalcon\\Registry is very fast (it is typically faster than any userspace implementation of the registry); however, this comes at a price: Phalcon\\Registry is a final class and cannot be inherited from.

Though Phalcon\\Registry exposes methods like __get(), offsetGet(), count() etc, it is not recommended to invoke them manually (these methods exist mainly to match the interfaces the registry implements): $registry->__get("property") is several times slower than $registry->property.

Internally all the magic methods (and interfaces except JsonSerializable) are implemented using object handlers or similar techniques: this allows to bypass relatively slow method calls.
