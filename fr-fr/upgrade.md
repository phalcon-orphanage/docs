# Upgrading to v4

So you have decided to upgrade to v4! **Congratulations**!!

Phalcon v4 contains a lot of changes to components, including changes to interfaces, strict types, removal of components and additions of new ones. This document is an effort to help you upgrade your existing Phalcon application to v4. We will outline the areas that you need to pay attention to and make necessary alterations so that your code can run as smoothly as it has been with v3. Although the changes are significant, it is more of a methodical task than a daunting one.

## Requirements

### PHP 7.2

Phalcon v4 supports only PHP 7.2 and above. PHP 7.1 was released 2 years ago and its [active support](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php) has lapsed, so we decided to follow actively supported PHP versions.

<a name='psr'></a>

### PSR

Phalcon requires the PSR extension. The extension can be downloaded and compiled from [this](https://github.com/jbboehr/php-psr) GitHub repository. Installation instructions are available in the `README` of the repository. Once the extension has been compiled and is available in your system, you will need to load it to your `php.ini`. You will need to add this line:

```ini
extension=psr.so
```

before

```ini
extension=phalcon.so
```

Alternatively some distributions add a number prefix on `ini` files. If that is the case, choose a high number for Phalcon (e.g. `50-phalcon.ini`).

### Installation

Download the latest `zephir.phar` from [here](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir/releases). Add it to a folder that can be accessed by your system.

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
```

Compile Phalcon

```bash
cd cphalcon/
git checkout tags/v4.0.0-alpha1 ./
zephir fullclean
zephir build
```

Check the module

```bash
php -m | grep phalcon
```

### Changed

- Renamed `Phalcon\Acl\Resource` to `Phalcon\Acl\Component`
- Renamed `Phalcon\Acl\ResourceInterface` to `Phalcon\Acl\ComponentInterface`
- Renamed `Phalcon\Acl\ResourceAware` to `Phalcon\Acl\ComponentAware`
- Renamed `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::isResource` to `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::isComponent`
- Renamed `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::addResource` to `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::addComponent`
- Renamed `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::addResourceAccess` to `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::addComponentAccess`
- Renamed `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::dropResourceAccess` to `Phalcon\Acl\AdapterInterface::dropComponentAccess`

## Assets

> Status: **changes required**
> 
> Usage: [Assets Documentation](assets)
{: .alert .alert-info }

CSS and JS filters have been removed from the [Assets](assets) component. Due to license limitations, the CSS and JS minifiers (filters) have been removed for v4. In future versions with the help of the community we can introduce these filters again. You can always implement your own using the supplied `Phalcon\Assets\FilterInterface`.

### Removed

- Removed `Phalcon\Assets\Filters\CssMin`
- Removed `Phalcon\Assets\Filters\JsMin`

## Cache

> Status: **changes required**
> 
> Usage: [Cache Documentation](cache)
{: .alert .alert-info }

The `Cache` component has been rewritten to comply with [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/). This allows you to use the [Phalcon\Cache](api/Phalcon_Cache) to any application that utilizes a [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/) cache, not just Phalcon based ones.

In v3, the cache was split into two components, the Frontend and the Backend. This did create a bit of confusion but it was functional. In order to create a cache component you had to create the Frontend first and then inject that to the relevant Backend (which acted as an adapter also).

For v4, we rewrote the component completely. We first created a `Storage` class which is the basis of the Cache classes. We created Serializer classes whose sole responsibility is to serialize and unserialize the data before they are saved in the cache adapter and after they are retrieved. These classes are injected (based on the developer's choice) to an Adapter object which connects to a backend (`Memcached`, `Redis` etc.), while abiding by a common adapter interface.

The Cache class implements [PSR-16](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/) and accepts an adapter in its constructor, which in turn is doing all the heavy lifting with connecting to the back end and manipulating data.

For a more detailed explanation on how the new Cache component works, please visit the relevant page in our documentation.

### Creating a cache

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Cache;
use Phalcon\Cache\Adapter\AdapterFactory;
use Phalcon\Storage\Serializer\SerializerFactory;

$serializerFactory = new SerializerFactory();
$adapterFactory    = new AdapterFactory($serializerFactory);

$options = [
    'defaultSerializer' => 'Json',
    'lifetime'          => 7200
];

$adapter = $adapterFactory->newInstance('apcu', $options);

$cache = new Cache($adapter);
```

Registering it in the DI

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Cache;
use Phalcon\Cache\Adapter\AdapterFactory;
use Phalcon\Storage\Serializer\SerializerFactory;

$container = new Di();

$container->set(
    'cache',
    function () {
        $options = [
            'defaultSerializer' => 'Json',
            'lifetime'          => 7200
        ];

        $adapter = (new AdapterFactory(new SerializerFactory()))
                    ->newInstance('apcu', $options); 

        return new Cache($adapter);
    }
);
```

## CLI

> Status: **changes required**
> 
> Usage: [CLI Documentation](cli)
{: .alert .alert-info }

### Parameters

Parameters now behave the same way as MVC controllers. Whilst previously they all existed in the `$params` property, you can now name them appropriately:

```php
use Phalcon\Cli\Task;

class MainTask extends Task
{
    public function testAction(string $yourName, string $myName)
    {
        echo sprintf(
            'Hello %s!' . PHP_EOL,
            $yourName
        );

        echo sprintf(
            'Best regards, %s' . PHP_EOL,
            $myName
        );
    }
}
```

* * *

## Filter

> Status: **changes required**
> 
> Usage: [Filter Documentation](filter)
{: .alert .alert-info }

The `Filter` component has been rewritten, utilizing a service locator. Each sanitizer is now enclosed on its own class and lazy loaded to provide maximum performance and the lowest resource usage as possible.

### Overview

The `Phalcon\Filter` object has been removed from the framework. In its place we have two components that can help with sanitizing input.

The equivalent of the v3 `Phalcon\Filter` is now the [Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocator](api/Phalcon_Filter_FilterLocator) object. This object allows you to sanitize input as before using the `sanitize()` method.

The values sanitized are automatically cast to the relevant types. This is the default behavior for the `int`, `bool` and `float` filters.

When instantiating the locator object, it does not know about any sanitizers. You have two options:

#### Load all the default sanitizers

You can load all the Phalcon supplied sanitizers by utilizing the [Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocatorFactory](Phalcon_Filter_FilterLocatorFactory) component.

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocatorFactory;

$factory = new FilterLocatorFactory();
$locator = $factory->newInstance();
```

Calling`newInstance()` will return a [Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocator](api/Phalcon_Filter_FilterLocator) object with all the sanitizers registered. The sanitizers are lazy loaded so they are instantiated only when called from the locator.

#### Load only sanitizers you want

You can instantiate the [Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocator](api/Phalcon_Filter_FilterLocator) component and either use the `set()` method to set all the sanitizers you need, or pass an array in the constructor with the sanitizers you want to register.

### Using the `FactoryDefault`

If you use the [Phalcon\Di\FactoryDefault](api/Phalcon_Di_FactoryDefault) container, then the [Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocator](api/Phalcon_Filter_FilterLocator) is automatically loaded in the container. You can then continue to use the service in your controllers or components as you did before. The name of the service in the Di is `filter`, just as before.

Also components that utilize the filter service, such as the [Request](api/Phalcon_Http_Request) object, transparently use the new filter locator. No additional changes required for those components.

### Using a custom `Di`

If you have set up all the services in the [Phalcon\Di](api/Phalcon_Di) yourself and need the filter service, you will need to change its registration as follows:

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Di;
use Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocatorFactory;

$container = new Di();

$container->set(
    'filter',
    function () {
        $factory = new FilterLocatorFactory();
        return $factory->newInstance();
    }
);
```

> Note that even if you register the filter service manually, the **name** of the service must be **filter** so that other components can use it
{: .alert .alert-warning }

### Constants

The constants that the v3 `Phalcon\Filter` have somewhat changed. They are now located in the [Phalcon\Filter\FilterLocator](api/Phalcon_Filter_FilterLocator) class.

#### Removed

- `FILTER_INT_CAST` (`int!`)
- `FILTER_FLOAT_CAST` (`float!`)

By default the service sanitizers cast the value to the appropriate type so these are obsolete

- `FILTER_APHANUM` has been removed - replaced by `FILTER_ALNUM`

#### Changed

- `FILTER_SPECIAL_CHARS` has changed been removed - replaced by `FILTER_SPECIAL`

#### Added

- `FILTER_ALNUM` - replaced `FILTER_ALPHANUM`
- `FILTER_ALPHA` - sanitize only alpha characters
- `FILTER_BOOL` - sanitize boolean including "yes", "no", etc.
- `FILTER_LOWERFIRST` - sanitze using `lcfirst`
- `FILTER_REGEX` - sanitize based on a pattern (`preg_replace`)
- `FILTER_REMOVE` - sanitize by removing characters (`str_replace`)
- `FILTER_REPLACE` - sanitize by replacing characters (`str_replace`)
- `FILTER_SPECIAL` - replaced `FILTER_SPECIAL_CHARS`
- `FILTER_SPECIALFULL` - sanitize special chars (`filter_var`)
- `FILTER_UPPERFIRST` - sanitize using `ucfirst`
- `FILTER_UPPERWORDS` - sanitize using `ucwords`

## Logger

> Status: **changes required**
> 
> Usage: [Logger Documentation](logger)
{: .alert .alert-info }

The `Logger` component has been rewritten to comply with [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/). This allows you to use the [Phalcon\Logger](api/Phalcon_Logger) to any application that utilizes a [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) logger, not just Phalcon based ones.

In v3, the logger was incorporating the adapter in the same component. So in essence when creating a logger object, the developer was creating an adapter (file, stream etc.) with logger functionality.

For v4, we rewrote the component to implement only the logging functionality and to accept one or more adapters that would be responsible for doing the work of logging. This immediately offers compatibility with [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) and separates the responsibilities of the component. It also offers an easy way to attach more than one adapter to the logging component so that logging to multiple adapters can be achieved. By using this implementation we have reduced the code necessary for this component and removed the old `Logger\Multiple` component.

### Creating a logger component

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Logger;
use Phalcon\Logger\Adapter\Stream;

$adapter = new Stream('/logs/application.log');
$logger  = new Logger(
    'messages',
    [
        'main' => $adapter,
    ]
);

$logger->error('Something went wrong');
```

Registering it in the DI

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Di;
use Phalcon\Logger;
use Phalcon\Logger\Adapter\Stream;

$container = new Di();

$container->set(
    'logger',
    function () {
        $adapter = new Stream('/logs/application.log');
        $logger  = new Logger(
            'messages',
            [
                'main' => $adapter,
            ]
        );

        return $logger;
    }
);
```

### Multiple loggers

The `Phalcon\Logger\Multiple` component has been removed. You can achieve the same functionality using the logger component and registering more than one adapter:

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Logger;
use Phalcon\Logger\Adapter\Stream;

$adapter1 = new Stream('/logs/first-log.log');
$adapter2 = new Stream('/remote/second-log.log');
$adapter3 = new Stream('/manager/third-log.log');

$logger = new Logger(
    'messages',
    [
        'local'   => $adapter1,
        'remote'  => $adapter2,
        'manager' => $adapter3,
    ]
);

// Log to all adapters
$logger->error('Something went wrong');
```

* * *

## Models

> Status: **changes required**
> 
> Usage: [Models Documentation](db-models)
{: .alert .alert-info }

### Initialization

The `getSource()` method has been marked as `final`. As such you can no longer override this method in your model to set the corresponding table/source of the RDBMS. Instead, you can now use the `initialize()` method and `setSource()` to set the source of your model.

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Mvc\Model;

class Users
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        $this->setSource('Users');
        // ....
    }
}
```

### Criteria

The second parameter of `Criteria::limit()` ('offset') must now be an integer or null. Previously there was no type requirement.

```php
$criteria->limit(10);

$criteria->limit(10, 5);

$criteria->limit(10, null);
```

* * *

## Router

You can add `CONNECT`, `PURGE`, `TRACE` routes to the Router Group. They function the same as they do in the normal Router:

```php
use Phalcon\Mvc\Router\Group;

$group = new Group();

$group->addConnect(
    '/api',
    [
        'controller' => 'api',
        'action'     => 'connect',
    ]
);

$group->addPurge(
    '/api',
    [
        'controller' => 'api',
        'action'     => 'purge',
    ]
);

$group->addTrace(
    '/api',
    [
        'controller' => 'api',
        'action'     => 'trace',
    ]
);
```

* * *

## Text

> Status: **changes required**
> 
> Usage: [Str Documentation](helpers#str)
{: .alert .alert-info }

The `Phalcon\Text` component has been removed in favor of the `Phalcon\Helper\Str`. The functionality offered by `Phalcon\Text` in v3 is replicated and enhanced in the new class: `Phalcon\Helper\Str`.
