# HTTP Request Component

* * *

## Checking operations

The [Phalcon\Http\Request](api/Phalcon_Http_Request) component contains a number of methods that help you check the current operation. For instance if you want to check if a particular request was made using AJAX, you can do so by using the `isAjax()` method. All the methods are prefixed with `is`. - `isAjax()`: Checks whether request has been made using AJAX - `isConnect()`: Checks whether HTTP method is CONNECT - `isDelete()`: Checks whether HTTP method is DELETE - `isGet()`: Checks whether HTTP method is GET - `isHead()`: Checks whether HTTP method is HEAD - `isMethod()`: Check if HTTP method match any of the passed methods - `isOptions()`: Checks whether HTTP method is OPTIONS - `isPatch()`: Checks whether HTTP method is PATCH - `isPost()`: Checks whether HTTP method is POST - `isPurge()`: Checks whether HTTP method is PURGE (Squid and Varnish support) - `isPut()`: Checks whether HTTP method is PUT - `isSecure()`: Checks whether request has been made using any secure layer - `isSoap()`: Checks whether request has been made using SOAP - `isTrace()`: Checks whether HTTP method is TRACE - `isValidHttpMethod()`: Checks if a method is a valid HTTP method

## Checking existence

There are a number of methods available that allow you to check the existence of elements in the request. These methods are prefixed with `has`. Depending on the method used, you can check if an element exists in the `$_REQUEST`, `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_SERVER`, `$_FILES`, PUT cache and the request headers. - `has()`: Checks whether the $_REQUEST superglobal has a certain element - `hasFiles()`: Checks whether the request has any uploaded files - `hasHeader()`: Checks whether the headers have a certain element - `hasPost()`: Checks whether $_POST superglobal has a certain element - `hasPut()`: Checks whether the PUT data has a certain element - `hasQuery()`: Checks whether $_GET superglobal has a certain element - `hasServer()`: Checks whether $_SERVER superglobal has a certain element
