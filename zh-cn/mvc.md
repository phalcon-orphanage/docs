# The MVC Architecture

Phalcon offers the object-oriented classes, necessary to implement the Model, View, Controller architecture (often referred to as [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller)) in your application. This design pattern is widely used by other web frameworks and desktop applications.

MVC benefits include:

* Isolation of business logic from the user interface and the database layer
* Making it clear where different types of code belong for easier maintenance

If you decide to use MVC, every request to your application resources will be managed by the MVC architecture. Phalcon classes are written in C language, offering a high performance approach of this pattern in a PHP based application.
