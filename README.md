You can find our documentation project in Crowdin [here](https://crowdin.com/project/phalcon-documentation)

## Contributing 

Phalcon is an open source PHP framework. This repository holds our documentation, one branch per version.

The repository contains all the languages that we have translations of our documentation for. The master language is English `en` and that is the only one that can be changed in this repository.

If you wish to contribute to our documentation you can do so as follows:

#### Changes to English documents
Submit a PR with your modifications **only** to the `en/` folder. Since the English folder is the 'master' one, any changes to the files under the `en/` folder will be propagated to the other languages.

#### Translations
You can start translating documentation in a language other than English that you speak. You can do so by joining our project in [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) [here](https://crowdin.com/project/phalcon-documentation/)
