# Welcome
Welcome to the documentation for the Phalcon framework.

## Mission
Our mission is to empower developers with an advanced, feature-rich tool: Phalcon. This framework is designed to facilitate the development of powerful applications with minimal server resource consumption and optimal performance.

## Phalcon nedir
Phalcon is an open-source full-stack framework for PHP, distinguished by its unique architecture written as a C-extension. This means that it is implemented in C and directly integrated into PHP for enhanced performance.

Its innovative architecture ensures that the framework is always memory-resident, providing functionality on demand without the overhead of file stats and reads typical in traditional PHP frameworks.

## KullanÄ±m
Phalcon is designed to be developer-friendly, and you don't need to be familiar with the C language to utilize its power. The framework's interface is exposed as PHP classes under the `Phalcon` namespace, making it accessible and easy to use.

Phalcon is loosely coupled, allowing developers to use only the objects that they need as glue components based in the needs of their applications.
