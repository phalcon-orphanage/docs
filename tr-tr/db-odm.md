> The Object Document Mapper functionality has been **temporarily** removed for v4.0.
> 
> The existing implementation was using a PHP MongoDB driver that has been deprecated for years. As such, work is underway to re-introduce the Object Document Mapper in Phalcon, using the latest MongoDB PHP driver.
> 
> We expect this functionality to be reintroduced a future Phalcon release.
