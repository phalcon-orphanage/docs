# Overview

Writing proper tests can assist in writing better software. If you set up proper test cases you can eliminate most functional bugs and better maintain your software.

<a name='integration'></a>

## Integrating PHPUnit with Phalcon

If you don't already have phpunit installed, you can do it by using the following composer command:

```bash
composer require phpunit/phpunit:^5.0
```

or by manually adding it to `composer.json`:

```json
<br />{
    "require-dev": {
        "phpunit/phpunit": "^5.0"
    }
}
```

Once PHPUnit is installed create a directory called `tests` in project root directory:

    app/
    public/
    tests/
    

Next, we need a 'helper' file to bootstrap the application for unit testing.

<a name='unit-helper'></a>

## The PHPUnit helper file

A helper file is required to bootstrap the application for running the tests. We have prepared a sample file. Put the file in your `tests/` directory as `TestHelper.php`.

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Di;
use Phalcon\Di\FactoryDefault;
use Phalcon\Loader;

ini_set("display_errors", 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);

define("ROOT_PATH", __DIR__);

set_include_path(
    ROOT_PATH . PATH_SEPARATOR . get_include_path()
);

// Required for phalcon/incubator
include __DIR__ . "/../vendor/autoload.php";

// Use the application autoloader to autoload the classes
// Autoload the dependencies found in composer
$loader = new Loader();

$loader->registerDirs(
    [
        ROOT_PATH,
    ]
);

$loader->register();

$di = new FactoryDefault();

Di::reset();

// Add any needed services to the DI here

Di::setDefault($di);
```

Should you need to test any components from your own library, add them to the autoloader or use the autoloader from your main application.

To help you build the Unit Tests, we made a few abstract classes you can use to bootstrap the Unit Tests themselves. These files exist in the [Phalcon Incubator](https://github.com/phalcon/incubator).

You can use the Incubator library by adding it as a dependency:

```bash
composer require phalcon/incubator
```

or by manually adding it to `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "phalcon/incubator": "^3.0"
    }
}
```

You can also clone the repository using the repo link above.

<a name='phpunit-config'></a>

## The `phpunit.xml` file

Now, create a `phpunit.xml` file as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<phpunit bootstrap="./TestHelper.php"
         backupGlobals="false"
         backupStaticAttributes="false"
         verbose="true"
         colors="false"
         convertErrorsToExceptions="true"
         convertNoticesToExceptions="true"
         convertWarningsToExceptions="true"
         processIsolation="false"
         stopOnFailure="false"
         syntaxCheck="true">

    <testsuite name="Phalcon - Testsuite">
        <directory>./</directory>
    </testsuite>
</phpunit>
```

Modify the `phpunit.xml` to fit your needs and save it in `tests`. This will run any tests under the `tests` directory.

## Sample Unit Test

To run any Unit Tests you need to define them. The autoloader will make sure the proper files are loaded so all you need to do is create the files and phpunit will run the tests for you.

This example does not contain a config file, most test cases however, do need one. You can add it to the `DI` to get the `UnitTestCase` file.

First create a base Unit Test called `UnitTestCase.php` in your `tests` directory:

```php
<?php

use Phalcon\Di;
use Phalcon\Test\UnitTestCase as PhalconTestCase;

abstract class UnitTestCase extends PhalconTestCase
{
    /**
     * @var bool
     */
    private $_loaded = false;

    public function setUp()
    {
        parent::setUp();

        // Load any additional services that might be required during testing
        $di = Di::getDefault();

        // Get any DI components here. If you have a config, be sure to pass it to the parent

        $this->setDi($di);

        $this->_loaded = true;
    }

    /**
     * Check if the test case is setup properly
     *
     * @throws \PHPUnit_Framework_IncompleteTestError;
     */
    public function __destruct()
    {
        if (!$this->_loaded) {
            throw new \PHPUnit_Framework_IncompleteTestError(
                "Please run parent::setUp()."
            );
        }
    }
}
```

It's always a good idea to separate your Unit Tests in namespaces. For this test we will create the namespace 'Test'. So create a file called `tests\Test\UnitTest.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace Test;

/**
 * Class UnitTest
 */
class UnitTest extends \UnitTestCase
{
    public function testTestCase()
    {
        $this->assertEquals(
            "works",
            "works",
            "This is OK"
        );

        $this->assertEquals(
            "works",
            "works1",
            "This will fail"
        );
    }
}
```

Now when you execute `phpunit` in your command-line from the `tests` directory you will get the following output:

```bash
$ phpunit

Configuration read from /var/www/tests/phpunit.xml

There was 1 failure:

```

Now you can start building your Unit Tests. You can view a [good guide here](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2009/08/24/writing-great-unit-tests-best-and-worst-practises/). We also recommend reading the PHPUnit documentation if you're not familiar with PHPUnit.
