## Download the right version of Phalcon

XAMPP is always releasing 32 bit versions of Apache and PHP. You will need to download the x86 version of Phalcon for Windows from the download section.

After downloading the Phalcon library you will have a zip file like the one shown below:

Extract the library from the archive to get the Phalcon DLL:

Copy the file `php_phalcon.dll` to the PHP extensions directory. If you have installed XAMPP in the `C:\xampp` folder, the extension needs to be in `C:\xampp\php\ext`

Edit the php.ini file, it is located at `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`. It can be edited with Notepad or a similar program. We recommend Notepad++ to avoid issues with line endings. Append at the end of the file:

```ini
extension=php_phalcon.dll
```

and save it.

Restart the Apache Web Server from the XAMPP Control Center. This will load the new PHP configuration.

Open your browser to navigate to `http://localhost`. The XAMPP welcome page will appear. Click on the link `phpinfo()`.

`phpinfo()` will output a significant amount of information on screen about the current state of PHP. Scroll down to check if the phalcon extension has been loaded correctly.
