Debugging Applications
======================
PHP language provides us facilities to debug applications, thanks to notices, warnings, errors and exceptionswe can know where exactly a problem has been generated: file, line, message, numeric code, backtrace, etc. With this information we could edit the file and fix the problem. OOP frameworks for PHP like Phalcon, mainly uses exceptions to encapsulate the details of an error. Exceptions generated by Phalcon are based on the standard PHP's  `Exception class <http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php>`_ .Despite being written in C, Phalcon runs methods in the PHP userland, this provides the same debug facilities thatany program madeâin PHP has. In this section of the documentation, we'll talk about debugging applications with Phalcon. 

Catching Exceptions
-------------------
Through all the tutorials and examples of the framework, there is a common element that is catching exceptions.This is usually done with a block try/catch: 

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    
    try {
    
     //... some phalcon code
    
    } catch(Phalcon_Exception $e) {
    
    }

Any exception thrown within the block is captured in the variable $e. A Phalcon_Exceptionhas nothing different with respect to a normal PHP exception, but allows us to know which are generated by the framework. All exceptions generated by PHP are based on the Exception class, and have at least the following elements:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    
    class Exception
    {
    
      /* Properties */
      protected string $message;
      protected int $code;
      protected string $file;
      protected int $line;
    
      /* Methods */
      public __construct ([ string $message = "" [, int $code = 0 [, Exception $previous = NULL ]]])
      final public string getMessage ( void )
      final public Exception getPrevious ( void )
      final public mixed getCode ( void )
      final public string getFile ( void )
      final public int getLine ( void )
      final public array getTrace ( void )
      final public string getTraceAsString ( void )
      public string __toString ( void )
      final private void __clone ( void )
    
    }

In the same way we get information from one exception, it is easy to see where an exception has been generated by Phalcon.For example, by printing additional information from the exception, we could see: 

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    
    try {
    
      //... app code ...
    
    } catch(Phalcon_Exception $e){
       echo get_class($e), ": ", $e->getMessage(), "\n"
       echo " File=", $e->getFile(), "\n";
       echo " Line=", $e->getLine(), "\n";
       echo $e->getTraceAsString();
    }

It's easy to know in which file and line of your code the exception occurred. Besides this, which components are involved in generating the exception.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    Warning: mysqli_real_connect(): (28000/1045): Access denied for user 'test'@'localhost'
    (using password: YES)  in /var/www/test/app/controllers/SignupController.php on line 15
    
    Phalcon_Db_Exception: Connection to MySQL failed
    File=/var/www/test/app/controllers/SignupController.php
    Line=15
    #0 [internal function]: Phalcon_Db_Adapter_Mysql->connect(Object(Phalcon_Config))
    #1 [internal function]: Phalcon_Db_Adapter_Mysql->__construct(Object(Phalcon_Config))
    #2 [internal function]: Phalcon_Db::factory('Mysql', Object(Phalcon_Config))
    #3 [internal function]: Phalcon_Db_Pool::getConnection()
    #4 [internal function]: Phalcon_Model_Manager->getConnection()
    #5 [internal function]: Phalcon_Model_Manager->load('Users')
    #6 [internal function]: Phalcon_Model_Manager->isModel('Users')
    #7 [internal function]: Phalcon_Model_Manager->autoload('Users')
    #8 /var/www/test/app/controllers/SignupController.php(15): spl_autoload_call('Users')
    #9 [internal function]: SignupController->registerAction('')
    #10 [internal function]: call_user_func_array(Array, Array)
    #11 [internal function]: Phalcon_Dispatcher->dispatch(Object(Phalcon_Request),
     Object(Phalcon_Response), Object(Phalcon_View), Object(Phalcon_Model_Manager))
    #12 /var/www/test/public/index.php(22): Phalcon_Controller_Front->dispatchLoop()
    #13 {main}

As you can see from the above output the Phalcon's classes and methods aredisplayed as normal in PHP, even show the parameters that have received each of them. The method  `Exception::getTrace <http://www.php.net/manual/en/exception.gettrace.php>`_ even gives you much more information.

Using XDebug
------------
`XDebug <http://xdebug.org/>`_ is an incredible tool that complements the debug of PHP applications.It is also a C extension for PHP, and you can use it together with Phalcon without additional configuration or effort. Once you have xdebug installed, you can use its API to get a more complete information about exceptionsand messages. The following example implements xdebug_print_function_stack to stop the execution and generate a backtrace: 

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    
    <?php
    
    class SignupController extends Phalcon_Controller
    {
    
            function indexAction()
            {
    
            }
    
            function registerAction()
            {
    
                    //Request variables from html form
                    $name = $this->request->getPost("name", "string");
                    $email = $this->request->getPost("email", "email");
    
                    //Stop execution and show a backtrace
                    return xdebug_print_function_stack("stop here!");
    
                    $user = new Users();
                    $user->name = $name;
                    $user->email = $email;
    
                    //Store and check for errors
                    $user->save();
            }
    
    }

Thois time, Xdebug also show us the variables in the local scope, and a backtrace as well:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    Xdebug: stop here! in /var/www/test/app/controllers/SignupController.php on line 15
    
    Call Stack:
        0.0005     640344   1. {main}() /var/www/test/public/index.php:0
        0.0014     645952   2. Phalcon_Controller_Front->dispatchLoop()
     /var/www/test/public/index.php:26
        0.0044     709504   3. SignupController->registerAction('')
     /var/www/test/public/index.php:0
        0.0046     710224   4. xdebug_print_function_stack('stop here!')
     /var/www/test/app/controllers/SignupController.php:15
    
    
    Variables in local scope (#3):
      $email = 'thecure@hotmail.com'
      $name = 'robert smith'
      $user = *uninitialized*

Xdebug provides several ways to get debug information and trace the execution ofyour applications using Phalcon. Check out its  `documentation <http://xdebug.org/docs>`_ to get more info
