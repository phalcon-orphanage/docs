Installation
============

PHP extensions require a slightly different installation method to a traditional php-based library or framework. You can either download a binary package for the system of your choice or build it from the sources.

During the last few months, we have extensively researched PHP's behavior, investigating areas for significant optimizations (big or small). Through understanding of the Zend Engine, we managed to remove unecessary validations, compacted code, performed optimizations and generated low-level solutions so as to achieve maximum performance from Phalcon.

.. highlights::
   Phalcon compiles with PHP 5.3.1, but due to old PHP bugs causing memory leaks, we highly recommend you to use at least PHP 5.3.11 or greater.

Windows
-------

To use phalcon on Windows you can download a DLL library. Edit your php.ini file and then append at the end:

    extension=php_phalcon.dll

Restart your webserver.

The following screencast is a step-by-step guide to install Phalcon on Windows:

Unix/Linux
----------

On a Unix/Linux system you can easily compile and install the extension from the source code:

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prerequisite packages are:

* PHP 5.x development resources
* GCC compiler (Linux) or Xcode (Mac)
* Git (if not already installed in your system - unless you download the package from GitHub and upload it on your server via FTP/SFTP)

.. code-block:: bash

    #Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install php5-dev php5-mysql gcc
    sudo apt-get install git-core

    #Suse
    yast2 -i php5-pear php5-dev php5-mysql gcc
    yast2 -i git-core

Compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating the extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon.git
    cd cphalcon/build
    export CC="gcc"
    export CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"
    phpize
    ./configure --enable-phalcon
    make
    sudo make install

Add extension to your php.ini

.. code-block:: bash

    extension=phalcon.so

Restart the webserver


FreeBSD
^^^^^^^
A port is available for FreeBSD. Just only need these simple line commands to install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    pkg_add -r phalcon

or

.. code-block:: bash

    export CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"
    cd /usr/ports/www/phalcon && make install clean
