Installation
============
PHP extensions require a slightly different installation method to a traditional php-based library or framework. You can either
download a binary package for the system of your choice or build it from the sources.

During the last few months, we have extensively researched PHP's behavior, investigating areas for significant
optimizations (big or small). Through understanding of the Zend Engine, we managed to remove unecessary validations,
compacted code, performed optimizations and generated low-level solutions so as to achieve maximum performance
from Phalcon.

.. highlights::
    Phalcon compiles from PHP 5.3.1, but because of old PHP bugs causing memory leaks, we highly recommend you use at least PHP 5.3.11 or greater.

.. highlights::
    PHP versions below 5.3.9 have several security flaws and these aren't recommended for production web sites. `Learn more <http://www.infoworld.com/d/security/php-539-fixes-hash-collision-dos-vulnerability-183947>`_

Windows
-------
To use phalcon on Windows you can download a DLL library. Edit your php.ini file and then append at the end:

    extension=php_phalcon.dll

Restart your webserver.

The following screencast is a step-by-step guide to install Phalcon on Windows:

Linux/Solaris/Mac
-----------------
On a Linux/Solaris/Mac system you can easily compile and install the extension from the source code:

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prerequisite packages are:

* PHP 5.3.x/5.4.x development resources
* GCC compiler (Linux/Solaris) or Xcode (Mac)
* Git (if not already installed in your system - unless you download the package from GitHub and upload it on your server via FTP/SFTP)

Specific packages for common platforms:

.. code-block:: bash

    #Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install git-core gcc autoconf
    sudo apt-get install php5-dev php5-mysql

    #Suse
    sudo yast -i gcc make autoconf2.13
    sudo yast -i php5-devel php5-mysql

    #CentOS/RedHat
    sudo yum install gcc make
    sudo yum install php-devel

    #Solaris
    pkg install gcc-45
    pkg install php-53 apache-php53

Compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating the extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon.git
    cd cphalcon/build
    sudo ./install

Add extension to your php.ini

.. code-block:: bash

    extension=phalcon.so

Restart the webserver.

Phalcon automatically detects your architecture, however, you can force the compilation for a specific architecture:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo ./install 32bits
    sudo ./install 64bits
    sudo ./install safe

FreeBSD
-------
A port is available for FreeBSD. Just only need these simple line commands to install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    pkg_add -r phalcon

or

.. code-block:: bash

    export CFLAGS="-O2 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"
    cd /usr/ports/www/phalcon && make install clean
