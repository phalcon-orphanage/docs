Hello World Benchmark
=====================

How the benchmarks were performed?
----------------------------------

We created a "Hello World" benchmark seeking to identify the smallest load overhead of each framework. Many people don't like this kind of benchmark because real-world applications require more complex features or structures. However, these tests identify the minimum time spent by each framework to perform a simple task. Such a task represents the mimimum requirement for every framework to process a single request.

More specifically, the benchmark only measures the time it takes for a framework to start, run an action and free up resources at the end of the request. Any PHP application based on an MVC architecture will require this time. Due to the simplicity of the benchmark, we ensure that the time needed for a more complex request will be higher.

A controller and a view have been created for each framework. The controller "say" and action "hello". The action only sends data to the view which displays it ("Hello!"). Using the "ab" benchmark tool we sent 1000 requests using 5 concurrent connections to each framework.

What measurements were recorded?
--------------------------------
These were the measurements we record to identify the overall performance of each framework:

* Requests per second
* Time across all concurrent requests
* Number of included PHP files on a single request (measured using function get_included_files_.
* Memory Usage per request (measured using function memory_get_usage_.

Pariticipant Frameworks
-----------------------

* Yii_ (YII_DEBUG=false) (yii-1.1.12.b600af)
* Symfony_ (2.0.11)
* `Zend Framework`_ (1.11.11)
* Kohana_ (3.2.0)
* FuelPHP_ (1.2.1)
* CakePHP_ (2.1.3)
* Laravel_ 3.2.5
* CodeIgniter_ (2.1.0)
* Nette_ (2.0.4)
