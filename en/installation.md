## Requirements

### PHP 7.2
Phalcon v4 supports only PHP 7.2 and above. PHP 7.1 has been released 2 years ago and its [active support][php-support] has lapsed, so we decided to follow actively supported PHP versions.

* Requirements
    * [PSR](installation-requirements-psr)
    * [PDO](installation-requirements-pdo)
    * [Hardware](installation-requirements-hardware)
    * [Software](installation-requirements-software)
* [Installation](installation-platforms)
    * [Linux](installation-linux)
    * [MacOS](installation-macos)
    * [Windows](installation-windows)
    * [Sources](installation-sources)
    * [Shared](installation-shared)
