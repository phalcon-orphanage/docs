Abstract class **Phalcon\\Mvc\\Model\\Query\\Lang**
===================================================

PHQL is implemented as a parser (written in C) that translates syntax in that of the target RDBMS. It allows Phalcon to offer a unified SQL language to the developer, while internally doing all the work of translating PHQL instructions to the most optimal SQL instructions depending on the RDBMS type associated with a model.  To achieve the highest performance possible, we wrote a parser that uses the same technology as SQLite. This technology provides a small in-memory parser with a very low memory footprint that is also thread-safe.
