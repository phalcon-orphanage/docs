# Installation

* * *

## Windows

To use Phalcon on Windows, you will need to install the phalcon.dll. We have compiled several DLLs depending on the target platform. The DLLs can be found in our [download](https://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows) page.

Identify your PHP installation as well as architecture. If you download the wrong DLL, Phalcon will not work. `phpinfo()` contains this information. In the example below, we will need the NTS version of the DLL:

![phpinfo](/assets/images/content/phpinfo-api.png)

The available DLLs are:

| Architecture | Version | Type                  |
|:------------:|:-------:| --------------------- |
|     x64      |   7.x   | Thread safe           |
|     x64      |   7.x   | Non Thread safe (NTS) |
|     x86      |   7.x   | Thread safe           |
|     x86      |   7.x   | Non Thread safe (NTS) |

Edit your php.ini file and then append at the end:

```ini
extension=php_phalcon.dll
```

Restart your webserver.
